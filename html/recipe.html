		<p>	Lasagne, singular lasagna) are wide, flat-shaped pasta, and possibly one of the oldest 
			types of pasta. The word "lasagne" and, in many non-Italian languages, the singular 
			"lasagna", can also refer to a dish made with several layers of lasagne sheets alternated 
			with sauces and various other ingredients.

		<div style="display:none;" id="readMore">
		<p>	Lasagne originated in Italy, traditionally ascribed to the city of Naples (Campania), 
			where the first modern recipe was created in the Middle Ages and published in Liber de Coquina 
			(The Book of Cookery), and became a traditional dish. Traditional lasagne is made by 
			interleaving layers of pasta with layers of sauce, made with ragù, bechamel, and 
			Parmigiano-Reggiano. In other regions and outside of Italy it is common to find lasagne made 
			with ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, various meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or 
			chicken), miscellaneous vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, mushrooms) and typically flavored 
			with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all cases the lasagne are oven-baked.
